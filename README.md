#  Ni-swarth – Donation Platform Frontend

Ni-swarth (नी-स्वार्थ) is a **web-based donation platform** built to bridge the gap between **donors** and **NGOs**, focusing on enabling seamless food and monetary donations. The platform was designed with the goal of encouraging transparent and efficient donation flows, especially in areas impacted by poverty, disasters, and hunger.

This project was built during **Graphathon 2.0 (National Hackathon)** and was **selected among the top 35 teams from thousands of entries.**

# Problem Statement

Many NGOs lack a centralized system to track and receive donations transparently, while willing donors often don't have a trustworthy and easy-to-use platform to contribute.

Ni-swarth solves this by:
- Connecting donors directly with NGOs
- Enabling donors to choose what and how to donate
- Ensuring visual and record-based transparency

# Key Features

-  **Clean, user-friendly frontend** designed using HTML and CSS
-  **Login & Register pages** for donors and NGO representatives
-  **Dashboard** to manage donation actions
-  **NGO Profiles** and real-time status of donations
-  **Impact Section** to showcase the work done and its reach
-  **Team and Solution pages** to present our mission, vision, and methodology
